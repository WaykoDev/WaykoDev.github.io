Hello everyone!

My name is Franck Chevalier, also known as **Wayko**, and I'm from Reunion Island ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. 

I am currently a student at [Ã‰cole 2600](https://ecole2600.com/), a cybersecurity school in France. 
In parallel, I'm interning at [Lexfo](https://lexfo.fr/), where I do penetration testing. 

I am passionate about Web, Misc and Active Directory. I'm always looking to learn new things, checking new technologies on social networks or IRC.

I also really enjoy doing CTFs. I participate mainly with [Phreaks 2600](https://www.phreaks2600.fr/) or with my company. 

I also do some on my own, such as Hack The Box, PortSwigger, YesWeHack - Dojo...

In terms of certifications, I am currently [OSCP](https://www.credential.net/8610ffb8-8dcc-45b6-99b6-ed5a62e7f6f2), [OSWA](https://www.credential.net/b9a2f97f-657f-4272-b1d5-ef1722a38d78), [KLCP](https://www.credential.net/e81fe53b-5ed9-432c-bea2-9c42378d9e0d), [CBBH](https://www.credly.com/badges/88204141-250d-41f7-b16d-154e584f4467) certified. 

I've also completed Hack The Box ProLabs: Zephyr, Dante and Genesis.
