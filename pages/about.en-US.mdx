Greetings everyone!

My name is Franck Chevalier, also known as **Wayko**. I am currently a student at [Ã‰cole 2600](https://ecole2600.com/), a cybersecurity school in France. 
In parallel, I'm interning at [Lexfo](https://lexfo.fr/), where I do penetration testing. 
I am passionate about Web, Misc and Active Directory.

I'm always looking to learn new things, checking new technologies on social networks or IRC.

I also really like doing CTFs, I do them mainly with the team from my school [Phreaks 2600](https://www.phreaks2600.fr/blog) or with my company. 
But I also do some on my side Hack The Box, PortSwigger, YesWeHack - Dojo...

In terms of certifications, I am currently OSCP, OSWA, KLCP, CBBH certified. 

I've also completed Hack The Box ProLabs: Zephyr, Dante and Genesis.

If you would like to discuss cybersecurity or any of the articles / writeups that I have written, feel free to contact me.
